{c:Verse 1}
Mine [A]eyes have seen the glory
Of the coming of the Lord
He is [D]trampling out the vintage
Where the [A]grapes of wrath are stored
He hath [A]loosed the fateful lightning
Of His terri-ble swift sword
His [D]truth is m[E]arch-ing [A]on

{c:Verse 2}
I have [A]seen Him in the watchfires
Of a hundred cir-cling camps
They have [D]builded Him an altar
In the [A]evening dews and damps
I can [A]read His righteous sentence
By the dim and flar-ing lamps
His [D]day is m[E]arch-ing [A]on [D] [C#] [B]

{c:Verse 3}
He has [A]sounded forth the trumpet
That shall never call re-treat
He is [D]sifting out the hearts of men
Be-[A]fore His judgment seat
O be [A]swift my soul to answer Him
Be jubi-lant my feet
Our [D]God is m[E]arch-ing [A]on

{c:Verse 4 - Softly}
In the [A]beauty of the lilies
Christ was born a-cross the sea
With a [D]glory in His bosom
That trans-[A]figures you and me
As He [A]died to make men holy
Let us live to make men free
While [D]God is m[E]arch-ing [A]on
