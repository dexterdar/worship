#Verse 1
Fo[G]llow the star to a place unexpected
W[Em]ould you believe after all we've projected
A c[Am]hild in a manger
L[G]owly and small the weakest of all
Un-lik[Em]eliest hero wrapped in His mother's s[Am]hawl
Just a child
Is this who we've waited [Dsus]from    [D]

{soc}
'cause H[G]ow many kings stepped down from their thrones
H[Em]ow many lords have abandoned their homes
H[Am]ow many greats have become the least for [Dsus]me    [D]
And h[G]ow many gods have poured out their hearts
To ro[Em]mance a world that is torn all apart
H[Am]ow many fathers gave up their sons for [Dsus]me    [D]
{eoc}

#Verse 2
Bri[G]nging out gifts for the newborn Savior
[Em]All that we have whether costly or meek
Be-c[Am]ause we believe
G[G]old for His honor and frankincense for His ple[Em]asure
And myrrh for the cross He'll suffer
[Am]Do you believe
Is this who we've waited [Dsus]from    [D]

{soc}
'cause H[G]ow many kings stepped down from their thrones
H[Em]ow many lords have abandoned their homes
H[Am]ow many greats have become the least for [Dsus]me    [D]
And h[G]ow many gods have poured out their hearts
To ro[Em]mance a world that is torn all apart
H[Am]ow many fathers gave up their sons for [Dsus]me    [D]
{eoc}

{sob}
[D]Only one did that [F] for me  [C] ooh[Am]
All for [F]me ah [Em] ah ah [D]
{eob}

{soc}
H[G]ow many kings stepped down from their thrones
H[Em]ow many lords have abandoned their homes
H[Am]ow many greats have become the least
H[G]ow many gods have poured out their hearts
To ro[Em]mance a world that is torn all apart
H[Am]ow many fathers gave up their sons for [Dsus]me    [D]
{eoc}

{c:Ending}
[D]Only one did that [G] for me oh [Em]
All for [Am]me all for [D]you     [G]
