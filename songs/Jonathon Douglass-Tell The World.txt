[F#m]'Cause there is none that compares to You

{c:Pre-Chorus}
'Cause [F#m]all I want in this [D]lifetime is [F#m]You   [D]
And [F#m]all I want in this [D]whole world is
[F#m]You  You  You  [Bm7][D]

{eoc}

#Verse 2
[F#m]   No longer I but Christ in me
[F#m]'Cause it's the truth that set me free
[F#m]How could this world be a better place
[F#m]By Thy mercy by Thy grace
