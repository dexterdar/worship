I will [G]cling to the old rug - ged [C]cross
And ex - [G]change it some [D]day for a [G]crown

#Verse 1
[G]On a hill far a - way stood an [C]old rugged cross
The [D]emblem of suff'ring and [G]shame
And I [G]love that old cross where the [C]dear - est and [C]best
For a [D]world of lost [D]sin - ners was [G]slain

{soc}
So I'll [D]cherish the old rugged [G]cross
Till my [C]trophies at last I lay [G]down
I will [G]cling to the old rug - ged [C]cross
And ex - [G]change it some [D]day for a [G]crown
{eoc}

#Verse 2
[G]O the old rugged cross so de - [C]spised by the world
Has a [D]wondrous at - traction for [G]me
For the [G]dear Lamb of God left His [C]glo - ry a - [C]bove
To [D]bear it to [D]dark Cal - va - [G]ry

{soc}
So I'll [D]cherish the old rugged [G]cross
Till my [C]trophies at last I lay [G]down
I will [G]cling to the old rug - ged [C]cross
And ex - [G]change it some [D]day for a [G]crown
{eoc}

#Verse 3
[G]In the old rugged cross stained with [C]blood so di - vine
A won - drous beauty I [G]see
For 'twas [G]on that old cross Jesus [C]suf - fered and [C]died
To [D]par - don and [D]sanc - ti - fy [G]me

{soc}
So I'll [D]cherish the old rugged [G]cross
Till my [C]trophies at last I lay [G]down
I will [G]cling to the old rug - ged [C]cross
And ex - [G]change it some [D]day for a [G]crown
{eoc}

#Verse 4
[G]To the old rugged cross I will [C]ev - er be true
It's shame and re - proach gladly [G]bear
Then He'll [G]call me some day to my [C]home far a - [C]way
Where His [D]glo - ry for - [D]ev - er I'll [G]share

{soc}
So I'll [D]cherish the old rugged [G]cross
Till my [C]trophies at last I lay [G]down
I will [G]cling to the old rug - ged [C]cross
And ex - [G]change it some [D]day for a [G]crown
