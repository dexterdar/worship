#Verse 1
[F#m]In the bleak mid-[D]winter [A]all creation [E]groans
[F#m]For a world in [D]darkness [A]frozen like a [E]stone
Light is [Bm7]breaking [D]  in a [A]stable for a [E]throne

And [F#m]He shall [D]reign forever-[A]more forever-[E]more

[F#m]Here within a [D]manger lies the [A]One who made the [E]starry skies
This [F#m]baby born for [D]sacrifice [A]Christ the Mes-[E]siah
In-[F#m]to our hopes in-[D]to our fears the [A]Savior of the [E]world appears
The [F#m]promise of e-[D/F#]ternal years [A]Christ the Mes-[E]siah
