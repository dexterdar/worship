{c:Intro}
The world in sol-emn still-ness lay
To hear the an-gels sing

#Verse 1
It c[G]ame up[C]-on the m[G]id-night clear
That g[C]lo-rious s[A]ong of o[D]ld
From a[G]n-gels be[C]nd-ing n[G]ear the earth
To to[C]uch their h[D]arps of g[G]old
Pe[B]ace on the earth go[Em]od will to men
From he[D]aven's all gra[A]cious K[D]ing
The w[G]orld in s[C]ol-emn s[G]till-ness lay
To h[C]ear the a[D]n-gels s[G]ing

#Verse 2
Still [G]thro' the c[C]lo-ven sk[G]ies they come
With pe[C]ace-ful w[A]ings un-fu[D]rled
And st[G]ill their hea[C]ven-ly m[G]u-sic floats
O'er a[C]ll the w[D]eary w[G]orld
Ab[B]ove its sad a[Em]nd low-ly plains
They b[D]end on ho[A]vering w[D]ing
And e[G]v-er o'[C]er its B[G]a-bel sounds
The bl[C]ess-ed a[D]n-gels s[G]ing

#Verse 3
For [G]lo the d[C]ays are ha[G]sten-ing on
By p[C]ro-phets se[A]en of [D]old
When w[G]ith the e[C]v-er-c[G]ir-cling years
Shall c[C]ome the ti[D]me foret[G]old
Wh[B]en the new heaven a[Em]nd earth shall own
The Pr[D]ince of Pe[A]ace their K[D]ing
And t[G]he whole wo[C]rld send ba[G]ck the song
Which n[C]ow the a[D]n-gels s[G]ing

{c:Ending}
Which n[C]ow the a[D]n-gels s[G]ing
