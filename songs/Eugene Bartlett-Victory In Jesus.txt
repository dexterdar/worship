{c:Intro}
[D]He plunged me to victory
Be[G]neath the c[A]leansing fl[D]ood

#Verse 1
[D]I heard an old old sto - ry
How a S[G]av - ior came from g[D]lo - ry
How He gave His life on Cal - va - ry
To s[E]ave a wretch like [A]me
[D]I heard about His groan - ing
Of His p[G]re - cious blood's a - [D]ton - ing
Then I repent - ed of my sins
And [G]won the [A]vic - to - [D]ry

{soc}
O v[D]ictory in Jesus
My S[G]av - ior for - [D]ev - er
He sought me and bo[D]ught me
With [E]His redeeming bl[A]ood
[D]He loved me ere I knew Him
And [G]all my love is [D]due Him
He plunged me to victory
Be[G]neath the c[A]leansing fl[D]ood
{eoc}

#Verse 2
[D]I heard about His heal - ing
Of His c[G]leans - ing pow'r re - v[D]eal - ing
How He made the lame to walk a - gain
And ca[E]used the blind to s[A]ee
A[D]nd then I cried dear Je - sus
Come and h[G]eal my bro - ken s[D]pir - it
And somehow Je - sus came and brought
To [G]me the [A]vic - to - [D]ry

[D]I heard about a man - sion
He has b[G]uilt for me in g[D]lo - ry

Be - y[E]ond the crys - tal s[A]ea
A[D]bout the angels sing - ing
And the o[G]ld redemp - tion s[D]to - ry
And some sweet day I'll sing up there
The s[G]ong of [A]vic - to - [D]ry
