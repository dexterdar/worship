O v[D]ictory in [D]Jesus   My S[G]av-ior for-[D]ev-er
He [D]sought me and bo[D]ught me   With [E]His redeeming bl[A]ood
He [D]loved me ere [D]I knew Him   And [G]all my love is [D]due Him
He [D]plunged me to [D]victory   Be[G]neath the c[A]leansing fl[D]ood

{c:Verse 1}
[D]I heard an old old [D]sto-ry   How a S[G]av-ior came from g[D]lo-ry
How [D]He gave His life on [D]Cal-va-ry   To s[E]ave a wretch like [A]me
I [D]heard about His [D]groan-ing   Of His p[G]re-cious blood's a-[D]ton-ing
Then [D]I repent-ed of my [D]sins   And [G]won the [A]vic-to-[D]ry

{c:Verse 2}
I [D]heard about His [D]heal-ing   Of His c[G]leans-ing pow'r re-v[D]eal-ing
How [D]He made the lame to [D]walk a-gain   And ca[E]used the blind to s[A]ee
And [D]then I cried dear [D]Je-sus   Come and h[G]eal my bro-ken s[D]pir-it
And [D]somehow Je-sus [D]came and brought   To [G]me the [A]vic-to-[D]ry

{c:Verse 3}
I [D]heard about a [D]man-sion   He has b[G]uilt for me in g[D]lo-ry
And I [D]heard about the [D]streets of gold   Be-y[E]ond the crys-tal s[A]ea
A[D]bout the angels [D]sing-ing   And the o[G]ld redemp-tion s[D]to-ry
And [D]some sweet day I'll [D]sing up there   The s[G]ong of [A]vic-to-[D]ry
